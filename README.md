### Reflection
The article "We Need to Decarbonize Software" describes what green software engineering is and what its benefits are for both software engineers and the environment. I found this article interesting because it delves into how things like websites and AI can impact the environment in ways people don’t usually think about such as unused code or improperly sized images on websites and excessive AI training. It explains that while software itself doesn’t emit carbon, the energy used by the hardware it runs on significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the article calls for software engineers to build more efficient and sustainable software that puts less stress on the hardware. 

I enjoyed the article because it gave actual tips on how software engineers can build greener software such as training AIs on less data, using lower resolution images on websites, and choosing hardware that is energy efficient. One of the most interesting tips was for engineers to use tools that measure the carbon footprint of systems. Overall, I found the article to be not only interesting, but very important as AI and software engineering continues to grow and environmental concerns continue to rise.
